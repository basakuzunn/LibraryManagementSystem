# help.fxml

## Explanation
This is an XML file that defines the layout of a JavaFX application. It uses the FXML markup language, which is an XML-based language provided by JavaFX. This file is used to separate the program logic from the layout, making the code easier to manage. The layout defined in this file is a VBox with a Label. The VBox is a layout pane that lays out its children in a single vertical column. The Label is a non-editable text control that displays a text to the user.

## Dependencies
This file depends on the JavaFX library, specifically the following classes:
- `javafx.geometry.Insets`
- `javafx.scene.control.Button`
- `javafx.scene.control.Label`
- `javafx.scene.layout.VBox`
- `javafx.scene.text.Font`

## Classes
There are no classes defined in this file.

## Functions
There are no functions defined in this file.

## Example usage
This FXML file is typically loaded in a JavaFX application using the `FXMLLoader` class. Here is an example:

```java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;
import javafx.scene.Parent;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class Main extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception{
        Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("help.fxml"));
        primaryStage.setTitle("Hello World");
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root, 300, 275));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `FXMLLoader.load()` method is used to load the FXML file. The loaded FXML file is then set as the root of the scene graph. The scene graph is the hierarchical tree of nodes that JavaFX uses to represent the user interface of a JavaFX application.
