# library.fxml

## Explanation
This is a JavaFX FXML file that defines the user interface for a library management system. It includes various UI components such as text fields for entering book details, buttons for adding, editing, and deleting books, a list view for displaying the books, and a search field for finding books. The UI also includes a help button and a home button.

## Dependencies
This FXML file depends on several JavaFX classes, which are imported at the top of the file. These include:
- `javafx.scene.control.Button`
- `javafx.scene.control.ListView`
- `javafx.scene.control.TextField`
- `javafx.scene.control.ToggleButton`
- `javafx.scene.layout.AnchorPane`
- `javafx.scene.text.Font`
- `javafx.scene.text.Text`

## Classes
There are no classes defined in this FXML file. However, it does reference a controller class, `library.main.librarymanagementsystem.application.LibraryController`, which handles the actions triggered by the UI components.

## Functions
There are no functions defined in this FXML file. However, it does reference several methods in the controller class, such as `#addItem`, `#searchBook`, `#editBook`, `#deleteBook`, and `#help`. These methods are triggered by various actions on the UI components.

## Example usage
This FXML file is used to define the user interface for a library management system. It is loaded by a JavaFX application, which then displays the UI and handles the user interactions. Here is an example of how this might be done:

```java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;
import javafx.scene.Parent;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class LibraryApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception{
        Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("library.fxml"));
        primaryStage.setTitle("Library Management System");
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root, 1312, 800));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `LibraryApp` class extends `Application` and overrides the `start` method. This method loads the FXML file, sets the title of the window, creates a new scene with the loaded root node and the specified dimensions, and displays the window. The `main` method launches the JavaFX application.
