## Dependencies

## Classes
There are no classes in this CSS file.

## Functions
There are no functions in this CSS file.

## Example usage
This CSS file can be used in a JavaFX application to style a ListView component. Here is an example of how to use it:

```java
// Import the necessary JavaFX classes
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.ListView;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class ListViewExample extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        // Create a ListView
        ListView<String> listView = new ListView<>();

        // Add some items to the ListView
        listView.getItems().addAll("Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3");

        // Set the CSS file
        listView.getStylesheets().add("listview.css");

        // Create a Scene and add the ListView to it
        Scene scene = new Scene(listView, 200, 200);

        // Add the Scene to the Stage
        primaryStage.setScene(scene);

        // Show the Stage
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
```

In this example, a ListView is created and some items are added to it. The CSS file `listview.css` is then set as the stylesheet for the ListView. This will apply the styles defined in the CSS file to the ListView. The ListView is then added to a Scene, which is added to a Stage, and the Stage is shown.
